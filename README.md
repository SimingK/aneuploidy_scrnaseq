Analysis code to reproduce all results and figures is available within the `scripts` directory. Scripts should be run in numerical order (00, 01, 02, ...etc.). 

Code to perform genotyping and allele-specific expression analysis are provided within the `scripts/genotyping` directory. We also provide the summarized output of this analysis (chromosome-wide measurements of allelic imbalance) in the `results` directory.
